## SIMULATION PROCEDURE:
1.	Open the Ltspice software
   
2.	FileNew Schematic
	
3.	Click component symbol  to browse and select the components
	
4.	Click OK and place the component
	
5.	Search for resistor from component menu or from the tab icons
	
6.	Place the resistors
	
7.	Use ctrl + R to rotate the components
	
8.	Use wire symbol  to connect the components as per the circuit diagram
	
9.	Right click each components to give the values
	
10.	Use run button  to run the simulation
	
11.	Set the step time and click ok
	
12.	Output dialog box will open
	
13.	In the output dialog box right click and select add traces
	
14.	Node voltages and current of each components names will be displayed.
	
15.	Select the required node voltages (V(n001)) to get the waveforms.
	
16.	To get the voltage across a component the name of the trace should represent both the nodes. example V(n001,n002))
